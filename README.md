## Before you Begin

Before beginning this tutorial, you will want to have some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript. Specifically, you will need to understand functions, objects, and arrays. Additionally, you should be familiar with some of the more recent ECMAScript features, such as arrow functions, let, const and the rest operator. It is also beneficial to have some familiarity with NPM, though it is not strictly necessary to begin.
