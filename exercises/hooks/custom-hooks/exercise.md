## Exercise

Our `Board` component is getting cluttered with all of this game logic. Let's use what we've learned in this section and create a custom hook called `useTicTacToe` to contain our game logic. To get started, create a file called `useTicTacToe.ts` next to the `Board` component (`Board.tsx`). After you have created `useTicTacToe`, use it in the `Board` component.

Once completed, run npm run dev and navigate to your application to ensure everything functions as before.
