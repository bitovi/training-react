## Exercise

Letâ€™s add some flare, powered by `useEffect`, to our game once someone has won. Inside the `Board` component, create a `useEffect` that depends on the `winner` value from the last section. It should check if there is a `winner`, and if there is, display an `alert` notifying the player they have won.

Once completed, double-check everything works by running `npm run dev` and navigating to your application. Play a quick game, so there is a winner, and you should see an `alert`.
