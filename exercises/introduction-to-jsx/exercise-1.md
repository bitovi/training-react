## Exercise One

Before getting started:

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bitovi/training-react.git

# change directory to
cd training-react

# checkout the correct branch for the first section
git checkout introduction-to-jsx

# install the dependencies
npm i

```

Give it a try! As is tradition, let's render our first react element that renders `Hello World` in an `h2` and from react in a `p` below it. To begin the exercise, go to `src/main.tsx`. To test out your solution, run `npm run dev`, and navigate to the page in your browser.
