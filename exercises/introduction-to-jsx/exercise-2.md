## Exercise 2

Create a JSX element that loops through the numbers `1-5` and creates buttons that, when clicked, show the number in an `alert`. You can create an alert using the browser's `alert` function, which can be used like this.

```ts
alert("hello world");
```

To begin this exercise, remove your previous element in `src/main.tsx`. To test your solution, run `npm run dev` and navigate to the page in your browser.
